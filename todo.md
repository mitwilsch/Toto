Next: Style UI components
Next: Cleanup flows, change position of calls as needed
Next: Make sure client, server, db can be separated to deploy

- Server should run container. Express will host the site, rewrite api server to put paths behind /api
- Mongodb can run in separate cloud instance
  Next: write copy, splash page, intro
