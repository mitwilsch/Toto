needs to post new user correctly
temp fix is `localStorage.setItem('id_token', 'abc123')` for Ui testing

Next: Style UI components
Next: Add user profile page, edit user details
Next: Cleanup flows, change position of calls as needed
Next: Double check all flows, new user, name not taken, etc
Next: Make sure client, server, db can be separated to deploy
Next: write copy, splash page, intro
